# SARIBO
SARIBO or Systematic and Automated Regulation of Irrigation systems for
Backyard farming Operations is an internet-of-things (iot) Irrigation System designed for Backyard Farming created using Arduino Nano and ESP8266 NodeMCU 12E. SARIBO is a waray-waray (Waray) term for "to water plants".

SARIBO contains two modules:

1. SARIBO Leaf Module (SARIBO Leaf). The SARIBO Leaf Module which controls the connected sensors and is placed on the field.
2. SARIBO Root Module (SARIBO Root). The SARIBO Root Module is the main controller module which controls the watering process, activation of relays for the pump and valves, water level among others.

The following are the required minimum hardware requirements for SARIBO:

| Hardware  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Arduino Nano ATmega328P CH340G  | The micro controller unit (MCU) responsible in the processing, management, control of the overall functionality of the system.  |
| NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 ESP-12E  | The micro controller unit (MCU) responsible in the establishment, control, management, of the Wi-Fi communication functionality of the system.  |
