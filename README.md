# SARIBO
SARIBO or Systematic and Automated Regulation of Irrigation systems for
Backyard farming Operations is an internet-of-things (iot) Irrigation System designed for Backyard Farming created using Arduino Nano and ESP8266 NodeMCU 12E. SARIBO is a waray-waray (Waray) term for "to water plants".

SARIBO contains two modules:

1. SARIBO Leaf Module (SARIBO Leaf). The SARIBO Leaf Module which controls the connected sensors and is placed on the field.
2. SARIBO Root Module (SARIBO Root). The SARIBO Root Module is the main controller module which controls the watering process, activation of relays for the pump and valves, water level among others.

The following are the required minimum hardware requirements for SARIBO:

| Hardware  | Description |
